# Chapter 2: The Pythagorean Theorem

## Introduction

The **Pythagorean theorem** is one of the most important relationships in mathematics. It describes a fundamental property of right triangles that has been used for thousands of years—from ancient Egypt to modern engineering. This theorem not only connects the sides of a right triangle but also forms the foundation for trigonometric ratios and many real-world applications.

In this chapter, we'll explore the theorem itself, understand why it works, and learn how to apply it to solve problems. By mastering the Pythagorean theorem, you're building essential skills for trigonometry.

## Section 2.1: Theorem Foundation

### The Pythagorean Theorem Statement

In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side, opposite the right angle) equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

**Mathematical Formula**:
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Where:
- **a** and **b** are the lengths of the two legs (the sides that form the right angle)
- **c** is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

### Understanding the Components

**The Hypotenuse**
- The longest side of a right triangle
- Always opposite the right angle
- The side that "closes" the triangle across from the right angle

**The Legs**
- The two sides that form the right angle
- Always shorter than the hypotenuse
- Called the "legs" because they form the corner

### Why It Works: Visual Proof

The Pythagorean theorem can be proven geometrically. If you draw squares on each side of a right triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse equals the sum of the areas of the squares on the two legs.

**Area relationships**:
- Square on leg a: area = a²
- Square on leg b: area = b²
- Square on hypotenuse c: area = c²
- Therefore: a² + b² = c²

### The Converse of the Pythagorean Theorem

The converse (reverse) of the theorem is also true:

**If the square of one side of a triangle equals the sum of the squares of the other two sides, then the triangle is a right triangle.**

Mathematically: If a² + b² = c², then the triangle is a right triangle.

This is useful for **verifying whether a triangle is a right triangle** when you know all three side lengths.

### Pythagorean Triples

A **Pythagorean triple** is a set of three positive whole numbers that satisfy the Pythagorean theorem.

**Common Pythagorean Triples**:
- (3, 4, 5) → 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5²
- (5, 12, 13) → 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13²
- (8, 15, 17) → 8² + 15² = 64 + 225 = 289 = 17²
- (7, 24, 25) → 7² + 24² = 49 + 576 = 625 = 25²

**Multiples of Pythagorean Triples** are also Pythagorean triples:
- (6, 8, 10) is 2 × (3, 4, 5)
- (9, 12, 15) is 3 × (3, 4, 5)

**Why These Matter**:
- Easy to recognize and work with
- Often appear in textbooks because they involve whole numbers
- Help develop intuition about right triangles

### Worked Examples

#### Example 2.1: Finding a Missing Leg

**Problem**: A right triangle has one leg of length 3 cm and a hypotenuse of length 5 cm. Find the length of the other leg.

**Solution**:

Using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²

Let a = 3 cm (known leg), b = unknown leg, c = 5 cm (hypotenuse)

$$3^2 + b^2 = 5^2$$

$$9 + b^2 = 25$$

$$b^2 = 25 - 9$$

$$b^2 = 16$$

$$b = \sqrt{16} = 4 \text{ cm}$$

**Answer**: The other leg is **4 cm**.

**Check**: 3² + 4² = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5² ✓
(This is the famous 3-4-5 Pythagorean triple!)

---

#### Example 2.2: Finding the Hypotenuse

**Problem**: A right triangle has legs of length 5 m and 12 m. Find the length of the hypotenuse.

**Solution**:

Using the Pythagorean theorem: a² + b² = c²

Let a = 5 m, b = 12 m, c = hypotenuse (unknown)

$$5^2 + 12^2 = c^2$$

$$25 + 144 = c^2$$

$$169 = c^2$$

$$c = \sqrt{169} = 13 \text{ m}$$

**Answer**: The hypotenuse is **13 m**.

**Check**: This is the 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple! ✓

#### Example 2.3: Verifying a Right Triangle

**Problem**: Is a triangle with sides 6 cm, 8 cm, and 10 cm a right triangle?

**Solution**:

To verify, check if the Pythagorean theorem holds. The longest side (10 cm) should be the hypotenuse.

$$6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100$$

$$10^2 = 100$$

Since 6² + 8² = 10², the equation holds true.

**Answer**: **Yes, this is a right triangle.**

**Note**: (6, 8, 10) is the 3-4-5 triple multiplied by 2.

## Section 2.2: Applications and Problem-Solving

### Using the Theorem in Real Situations

The Pythagorean theorem appears everywhere:
- **Construction**: Ensuring walls are perpendicular (square corners)
- **Navigation**: Calculating distances between points
- **Engineering**: Designing structures with specific angles
- **Ladder placement**: Finding safe distances from walls

### Distance Formula Connection

The distance between two points in a coordinate plane can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. If two points are at (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂):

$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

This is the Pythagorean theorem applied to a coordinate system!

### Multi-Step Problems

Many real-world problems require multiple applications of the Pythagorean theorem or combining it with other geometric concepts.

### Worked Examples

#### Example 2.4: Application - Ladder Problem

**Problem**: A 10-meter ladder is placed against a wall. The base of the ladder is 6 meters from the wall. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?

**Solution**:

Visualize this as a right triangle:
- Hypotenuse (ladder) = 10 m
- One leg (distance from wall) = 6 m
- Other leg (height on wall) = unknown (h)

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$6^2 + h^2 = 10^2$$

$$36 + h^2 = 100$$

$$h^2 = 64$$

$$h = 8 \text{ meters}$$

**Answer**: The ladder reaches **8 meters** up the wall.

#### Example 2.5: Application - Distance Between Points

**Problem**: Find the distance between points A(0, 0) and B(3, 4) on a coordinate plane.

**Solution**:

Using the distance formula (which is the Pythagorean theorem):
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

$$d = \sqrt{(3-0)^2 + (4-0)^2}$$

$$d = \sqrt{9 + 16}$$

$$d = \sqrt{25} = 5$$

**Answer**: The distance is **5 units**.

#### Example 2.6: Comparing Sides Using the Theorem

**Problem**: In a right triangle, is side a larger or smaller than side b if:
- Leg a = 7 inches
- Leg b = ? inches
- Hypotenuse c = 15 inches

**Solution**:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

$$7^2 + b^2 = 15^2$$

$$49 + b^2 = 225$$

$$b^2 = 176$$

$$b = \sqrt{176} \approx 13.27 \text{ inches}$$

**Answer**: Since 13.27 > 7, side **b is larger than side a**.

### Practice Problems

**Problem 2.6**: A rectangle has dimensions 7 cm by 10 cm. Find the length of its diagonal.

## Section 2.3: Chapter Summary

### Key Theorems and Formulas

**Pythagorean Theorem**: a² + b² = c²

**Converse**: If a² + b² = c², then the triangle is a right triangle.

**Distance Formula**: $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$

### Common Pythagorean Triples

- (3, 4, 5)
- (5, 12, 13)
- (8, 15, 17)
- (7, 24, 25)

And all multiples of these.

### When to Use the Pythagorean Theorem

Use the theorem when:
- You know two sides of a right triangle and need the third
- You need to verify if a triangle is a right triangle
- You're finding distances in geometry or on a coordinate plane
- You're working with real-world problems involving perpendicular relationships

### Why This Matters for Trigonometry

The Pythagorean theorem is absolutely essential for trigonometry because:

1. **It defines right triangles** - Trigonometric ratios only apply to right triangles
2. **It connects sides and angles** - The relationship between sides is foundational to understanding sine, cosine, and tangent
3. **It's used in verifying calculations** - You can check trigonometric calculations using the Pythagorean theorem
4. **It appears throughout applications** - Many real-world problems use both the theorem and trigonometric ratios

### Looking Ahead

In **Chapter 3**, we'll introduce **trigonometric ratios** (sine, cosine, tangent), which connect the angles of a right triangle to the relationships between its sides. Understanding the Pythagorean theorem makes learning these ratios much easier!
