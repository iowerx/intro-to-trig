# Chapter 3: Trigonometric Ratios in Right Triangles

## Introduction

Now that you understand the foundations of geometry and the Pythagorean theorem, we're ready to explore the heart of trigonometry: **trigonometric ratios**. These ratios connect the angles of a right triangle to the relationships between its sides, allowing us to solve problems involving distances, heights, and angles that would be difficult or impossible to measure directly.

Trigonometry literally means "triangle measurement," and the trigonometric ratios—sine, cosine, and tangent—are the fundamental tools that make this measurement possible. Ancient astronomers, navigators, and surveyors used these ratios to measure the heavens, chart the seas, and map the land. Today, they're essential in fields from architecture to video game design.

## Section 3.1: Introduction to Trigonometric Ratios

### What Are Trigonometric Ratios?

A **trigonometric ratio** compares two sides of a right triangle. The value of the ratio depends on the size of one of the acute angles in the triangle.

**Key Insight**: For a given angle measure, the ratio between certain sides of a right triangle is always the same, regardless of the triangle's size. This consistent relationship is what makes trigonometry so powerful.

### Labeling Right Triangle Components

Before we can work with trigonometric ratios, we need to understand how to label a right triangle relative to a specific angle.

**The Three Sides (relative to an acute angle θ)**:

1. **Hypotenuse** - The longest side, always opposite the right angle
2. **Opposite side** - The side across from the angle θ
3. **Adjacent side** - The side next to the angle θ (not the hypotenuse)

**Important**: The "opposite" and "adjacent" sides change depending on which angle you're considering! The hypotenuse never changes.

### The Three Primary Trigonometric Ratios

**Sine (sin)**
$$\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

**Cosine (cos)**
$$\cos \theta = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}$$

**Tangent (tan)**
$$\tan \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

Where θ (theta) represents the angle we're working with.

### Understanding the Ratios

**Sine** tells us how "tall" the triangle is relative to its hypotenuse. It compares the vertical height to the longest side.

**Cosine** tells us how "wide" the triangle is relative to its hypotenuse. It compares the horizontal distance to the longest side.

**Tangent** tells us the "steepness" or slope of the triangle. It compares height to horizontal distance.

### Why These Ratios Are Constant

If you create two right triangles with the same acute angle but different sizes, the triangles are **similar** (same shape, different size). Similar triangles have proportional sides, so the ratios remain constant.

This is why a 30° angle always has the same sine value (0.5), regardless of how large the triangle is!

### Worked Examples

#### Example 3.1: Identifying Triangle Components

**Problem**: In right triangle ABC with right angle at C, identify the opposite side, adjacent side, and hypotenuse relative to angle A if:
- Side AB (connecting A to B) = 13 cm
- Side AC (connecting A to C) = 5 cm
- Side BC (connecting B to C) = 12 cm

**Solution**:

First, identify the right angle: at C

Relative to angle A:
- **Hypotenuse**: AB = 13 cm (opposite the right angle, longest side)
- **Opposite side**: BC = 12 cm (across from angle A)
- **Adjacent side**: AC = 5 cm (next to angle A, forming the angle)

**Verification**: Check using Pythagorean theorem:
5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13² ✓

---

#### Example 3.2: Calculating Basic Trigonometric Ratios

**Problem**: Using the triangle from Example 3.1, find sin A, cos A, and tan A.

**Solution**:

From Example 3.1:
- Opposite = 12 cm
- Adjacent = 5 cm
- Hypotenuse = 13 cm

$$\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{12}{13}$$

$$\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{5}{13}$$

$$\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{12}{5}$$

**Answer**:
- sin A = 12/13 ≈ 0.923
- cos A = 5/13 ≈ 0.385
- tan A = 12/5 = 2.4

---

#### Example 3.3: Finding Ratios for the Other Angle

**Problem**: Using the same triangle, find sin B, cos B, and tan B.

**Solution**:

Now we're working with angle B. The labels change:
- Hypotenuse: still AB = 13 cm (never changes)
- Opposite (to angle B): AC = 5 cm
- Adjacent (to angle B): BC = 12 cm

$$\sin B = \frac{5}{13}$$

$$\cos B = \frac{12}{13}$$

$$\tan B = \frac{5}{12}$$

**Important observation**: Notice that sin A = cos B and cos A = sin B. This is because angles A and B are complementary (they sum to 90°)!

#### Example 3.4: Using the 3-4-5 Triangle

**Problem**: Find all six trigonometric ratios (including reciprocals) for the 30° angle in a 3-4-5 right triangle where the side opposite the angle is 3 units.

**Solution**:

In this triangle:
- Opposite = 3
- Adjacent = 4
- Hypotenuse = 5

**Primary ratios**:
$$\sin \theta = \frac{3}{5} = 0.6$$

$$\cos \theta = \frac{4}{5} = 0.8$$

$$\tan \theta = \frac{3}{4} = 0.75$$

**Reciprocal ratios** (covered in next section):
$$\csc \theta = \frac{5}{3} \approx 1.667$$

$$\sec \theta = \frac{5}{4} = 1.25$$

$$\cot \theta = \frac{4}{3} \approx 1.333$$

## Section 3.2: Right Triangle Components and SOHCAHTOA

### The SOHCAHTOA Mnemonic

**SOHCAHTOA** is a memory device to help you remember the three primary trigonometric ratios:

- **SOH**: **S**ine = **O**pposite / **H**ypotenuse
- **CAH**: **C**osine = **A**djacent / **H**ypotenuse
- **TOA**: **T**angent = **O**pposite / **A**djacent

Many students find this easier to remember by creating a sentence: "Some Old Hippie Caught Another Hippie Tripping On Acid" (or any other memorable phrase you prefer!).

### Reciprocal Trigonometric Functions

In addition to sine, cosine, and tangent, there are three reciprocal functions:

**Cosecant (csc)** - reciprocal of sine
$$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{opposite}}$$

**Secant (sec)** - reciprocal of cosine
$$\sec \theta = \frac{1}{\cos \theta} = \frac{\text{hypotenuse}}{\text{adjacent}}$$

**Cotangent (cot)** - reciprocal of tangent
$$\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{opposite}}$$

### When to Use Each Ratio

The key to selecting the right trigonometric ratio is identifying which sides you know and which you need to find:

**Use sine** when working with:
- Opposite side and hypotenuse
- Problems involving vertical heights

**Use cosine** when working with:
- Adjacent side and hypotenuse
- Problems involving horizontal distances

**Use tangent** when working with:
- Opposite and adjacent sides (no hypotenuse)
- Slope or steepness problems

### Complementary Angle Relationships

In a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary (sum to 90°). This creates special relationships:

**Cofunction identities**:
- sin θ = cos(90° - θ)
- cos θ = sin(90° - θ)
- tan θ = cot(90° - θ)

This is why the sine of one acute angle equals the cosine of the other acute angle!

### Worked Examples

#### Example 3.5: Applying SOHCAHTOA

**Problem**: A right triangle has a hypotenuse of 20 meters and one angle of 40°. The side opposite this angle is x meters. Which trigonometric ratio should you use, and what equation would you set up?

**Solution**:

**Given**:
- Hypotenuse = 20 m
- Angle = 40°
- Opposite = x (unknown)

**Analysis**: We have the hypotenuse and need the opposite side. Using SOHCAHTOA:
- SOH: Sine = Opposite / Hypotenuse ✓ (This matches our known and unknown!)

**Equation**:
$$\sin 40° = \frac{x}{20}$$

**Solving**:
$$x = 20 \sin 40°$$
$$x = 20(0.643) \approx 12.86 \text{ meters}$$

**Answer**: The opposite side is approximately **12.86 meters**.

---

#### Example 3.6: Using Reciprocal Functions

**Problem**: If sin θ = 5/13, find csc θ without using a calculator.

**Solution**:

By definition, cosecant is the reciprocal of sine:

$$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{\sin \theta}$$

$$\csc \theta = \frac{1}{5/13} = \frac{13}{5}$$

**Answer**: csc θ = **13/5 = 2.6**

**Note**: You can also think of this as "flip the fraction."

---

#### Example 3.7: Finding All Ratios from One

**Problem**: If cos A = 4/5 in a right triangle, find all other trigonometric ratios for angle A.

**Solution**:

Given: cos A = 4/5, which means adjacent = 4 and hypotenuse = 5

**Step 1**: Find the opposite side using Pythagorean theorem:
$$a^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$$
$$a^2 + 16 = 25$$
$$a^2 = 9$$
$$a = 3$$

**Step 2**: Calculate all ratios:
- sin A = 3/5 = 0.6
- cos A = 4/5 = 0.8 (given)
- tan A = 3/4 = 0.75
- csc A = 5/3 ≈ 1.667
- sec A = 5/4 = 1.25
- cot A = 4/3 ≈ 1.333

**Verification**: Check that reciprocals multiply to 1:
- (3/5)(5/3) = 1 ✓
- (4/5)(5/4) = 1 ✓
- (3/4)(4/3) = 1 ✓

---

#### Example 3.8: Using Cofunction Identities

**Problem**: If sin 28° = 0.469, what is cos 62°? Explain your reasoning.

**Solution**:

Notice that 28° + 62° = 90°, so these angles are complementary.

Using the cofunction identity:
$$\sin \theta = \cos(90° - \theta)$$

$$\sin 28° = \cos(90° - 28°) = \cos 62°$$

**Answer**: cos 62° = **0.469**

**Explanation**: In a right triangle, the two acute angles are complementary. The sine of one angle equals the cosine of its complement because the "opposite" side for one angle is the "adjacent" side for the other angle.

1. Given: hypotenuse = 15, angle = 30°, adjacent side = x
2. Given: opposite = 8, adjacent = x, angle = 45°
3. Given: hypotenuse = 25, angle = 60°, opposite = x

**Problem 3.10**: If tan θ = 7/24, find all six trigonometric ratios for angle θ.

**Problem 3.11**: Find the reciprocal of each:
1. sin θ = 0.5
2. cos θ = 0.866
3. tan θ = 1.732

**Problem 3.12**: Use cofunction identities to complete:
1. sin 15° = cos __°
2. cos 73° = sin __°
3. tan 41° = cot __°

**Problem 3.13**: If sec θ = 13/12, find cos θ and explain your reasoning.

**Problem 3.14**: In a right triangle, if one angle is x°, express the sine of the other acute angle in terms of x.

**Problem 3.15**: Explain why tan 45° = 1 without using a calculator.

**Problem 3.16**: If cot A = 2, what is tan A?

## Section 3.3: Applying Trigonometric Ratios

### Finding Unknown Sides

When you know one side and one acute angle of a right triangle, you can find any other side using trigonometric ratios.

**General Strategy**:
1. Draw and label the triangle
2. Identify the given angle and what you know/need
3. Choose the appropriate ratio (SOHCAHTOA)
4. Set up the equation
5. Solve for the unknown
6. Check reasonableness

### Finding Unknown Angles

If you know all three sides of a right triangle, you can find the acute angles using inverse trigonometric functions (which we'll study in detail in Chapter 7).

For now, you can verify angle calculations by checking that all three angles sum to 180°.

### Real-World Problem Types

**Height problems**: Finding the height of buildings, trees, or mountains
**Distance problems**: Finding horizontal distances that can't be measured directly
**Angle of elevation**: Angle above horizontal
**Angle of depression**: Angle below horizontal

### Problem-Solving Tips

1. **Always draw a diagram** - Label all known information
2. **Check which angle** you're working with - Opposite and adjacent depend on this
3. **Use consistent units** - Convert if necessary
4. **Verify your answer** - Does it make sense? Is it reasonable?
5. **Use Pythagorean theorem** to check - All three sides should satisfy a² + b² = c²

### Worked Examples

#### Example 3.9: Finding a Missing Side (Opposite)

**Problem**: A 15-foot ladder leans against a wall, making a 70° angle with the ground. How high up the wall does the ladder reach?

**Solution**:

**Draw and label**:
- Hypotenuse (ladder) = 15 ft
- Angle with ground = 70°
- Opposite (height up wall) = h (unknown)

**Choose ratio**: We have hypotenuse, need opposite → use SINE

$$\sin 70° = \frac{h}{15}$$

$$h = 15 \sin 70°$$

$$h = 15(0.940)$$

$$h \approx 14.1 \text{ feet}$$

**Answer**: The ladder reaches approximately **14.1 feet** up the wall.

**Check**: This makes sense because sin 70° is close to 1, so h should be close to 15 ft. ✓

---

#### Example 3.10: Finding a Missing Side (Adjacent)

**Problem**: From a point 50 meters from the base of a building, the angle of elevation to the top is 35°. How tall is the building?

**Solution**:

**Draw and label**:
- Adjacent (horizontal distance) = 50 m
- Angle of elevation = 35°
- Opposite (building height) = h (unknown)

**Choose ratio**: We have adjacent, need opposite → use TANGENT

$$\tan 35° = \frac{h}{50}$$

$$h = 50 \tan 35°$$

$$h = 50(0.700)$$

$$h = 35 \text{ meters}$$

**Answer**: The building is approximately **35 meters** tall.

#### Example 3.11: Multi-Step Problem

**Problem**: A kite is flying at the end of a 100-meter string. The string makes a 65° angle with the ground. Assuming the string is straight:
a) How high is the kite?
b) How far horizontally is the kite from the person?

**Solution**:

**Part a: Height (opposite)**

$$\sin 65° = \frac{h}{100}$$

$$h = 100 \sin 65°$$

$$h = 100(0.906) = 90.6 \text{ meters}$$

**Part b: Horizontal distance (adjacent)**

$$\cos 65° = \frac{d}{100}$$

$$d = 100 \cos 65°$$

$$d = 100(0.423) = 42.3 \text{ meters}$$

**Answers**:
a) The kite is approximately **90.6 meters** high
b) The kite is approximately **42.3 meters** horizontally from the person

**Verification using Pythagorean theorem**:
$$90.6^2 + 42.3^2 = 8208.36 + 1789.29 = 9997.65 \approx 100^2$$ ✓

#### Example 3.12: Working Backwards to Find an Angle

**Problem**: A right triangle has sides 8, 15, and 17. If we call the angle opposite the 8-unit side angle A, what is sin A?

**Solution**:

Relative to angle A:
- Opposite = 8
- Hypotenuse = 17

$$\sin A = \frac{8}{17} \approx 0.471$$

**Answer**: sin A = **8/17 ≈ 0.471**

**Note**: In Chapter 7, we'll learn how to find the actual angle measure (approximately 28.1°) using inverse trigonometric functions.
