## Section 1.1: Triangle Types and Properties

### What is a Triangle?

A **triangle** is a polygon with three sides, three angles, and three vertices (corner points). Triangles are among the most fundamental shapes in geometry and serve as the foundation for trigonometry.

**Key Components of a Triangle:**
- **Sides**: The three line segments that form the triangle's boundary
- **Angles**: The three angles formed where sides meet
- **Vertices**: The three points where sides intersect

**Important Property**: The sum of all three angles in any triangle equals **180 degrees**.

### Types of Triangles

Triangles are classified in two main ways: by their sides and by their angles.

#### Classification by Sides

**Equilateral Triangle**
- All three sides have equal length
- All three angles are equal (each measures 60°)
- Perfectly balanced and symmetrical

**Isosceles Triangle**
- Two sides have equal length
- Two angles are equal (the angles opposite the equal sides)
- Has a line of symmetry

**Scalene Triangle**
- All three sides have different lengths
- All three angles are different sizes
- Asymmetrical shape

#### Classification by Angles

**Acute Triangle**
- All three angles are less than 90°
- Sometimes called "sharp" triangles
- Often appears pointed or well-balanced

**Right Triangle**
- One angle is exactly 90° (a right angle, shown with a small square)
- The other two angles are acute (less than 90°)
- Sides have special relationships (Pythagorean theorem)
- **Most important for trigonometry!**

**Obtuse Triangle**
- One angle is greater than 90° (obtuse)
- The other two angles are acute
- Often appears "flat" or spread out

### Important Geometric Properties

**Angle Sum Property**: The sum of all three interior angles in any triangle is always 180°.

If a triangle has angles A, B, and C, then:
$$A + B + C = 180°$$

**Exterior Angle Property**: An exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

**Vertex Relationships**: Understanding how angles and sides relate at vertices is crucial for later work with trigonometric ratios.

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1.1: Identifying Triangle Types

**Problem**: Classify each triangle:
1. A triangle with sides 5 cm, 5 cm, and 7 cm
2. A triangle with angles 45°, 45°, and 90°
3. A triangle with angles 30°, 60°, and 90°

**Solution**:

1. **First triangle (5 cm, 5 cm, 7 cm)**
   - Two sides are equal (5 cm each)
   - **Classification by sides**: Isosceles triangle
   - To classify by angles, we'd need to calculate them using more advanced methods

2. **Second triangle (45°, 45°, 90°)**
   - One angle is exactly 90°
   - **Classification by angles**: Right triangle
   - The two equal 45° angles suggest this is also isosceles (since equal angles opposite equal sides)
   - **Full classification**: Isosceles right triangle

3. **Third triangle (30°, 60°, 90°)**
   - One angle is exactly 90°
   - **Classification by angles**: Right triangle
   - This is a special right triangle (30-60-90)
   - All three sides have different lengths
   - **Full classification**: Scalene right triangle

#### Example 1.2: Using the Angle Sum Property

**Problem**: In a triangle, one angle measures 50°, another measures 65°. What is the measure of the third angle?

**Solution**:

Using the angle sum property:
$$A + B + C = 180°$$

Substituting known values:
$$50° + 65° + C = 180°$$

$$115° + C = 180°$$

$$C = 180° - 115°$$

$$C = 65°$$

**Answer**: The third angle measures **65°**.

**Note**: Since two angles are equal (65° each), this is an **isosceles triangle**.

#### Example 1.3: Finding an Exterior Angle

**Problem**: A triangle has interior angles of 40°, 70°, and 70°. If you extend one of the sides forming the 40° angle, what is the measure of the exterior angle formed?

**Solution**:

Using the exterior angle property: An exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles.

The two non-adjacent angles (the ones not at the vertex where the exterior angle is formed) are 70° and 70°.

**Exterior angle** = 70° + 70° = **140°**

**Verification**: The exterior angle and its adjacent interior angle should sum to 180°:
- 140° + 40° = 180° ✓

## Section 1.2: Angle Fundamentals

### What is an Angle?

An **angle** is formed by two rays that share a common endpoint (called the vertex). Angles measure the amount of rotation from one ray to the other, typically measured in degrees.

**Angle Notation**: An angle can be labeled with three letters (with the vertex in the middle) or with a single letter or number representing the vertex.

### Angle Types

**Acute Angle**
- Measures less than 90°
- Sharp or pointed appearance
- Examples: 30°, 45°, 60°, 80°

**Right Angle**
- Measures exactly 90°
- Shown with a small square symbol in diagrams
- Created when two perpendicular lines meet
- Example: Corners of a square or rectangle

**Obtuse Angle**
- Measures greater than 90° but less than 180°
- Wide or spread-out appearance
- Examples: 100°, 120°, 150°

**Straight Angle**
- Measures exactly 180°
- Forms a straight line
- Actually two rays pointing in opposite directions

### Angle Relationships

**Complementary Angles**
- Two angles that sum to exactly 90°
- Example: 30° and 60° are complementary
- In a right triangle, the two acute angles are always complementary
- If one angle is x°, its complement is (90 - x)°

**Supplementary Angles**
- Two angles that sum to exactly 180°
- Example: 120° and 60° are supplementary
- Often found on a straight line
- If one angle is x°, its supplement is (180 - x)°

**Vertical Angles**
- Angles opposite each other when two lines intersect
- Vertical angles are always equal
- Important for understanding geometry diagrams

**Adjacent Angles**
- Angles that share a common vertex and a common side
- Found frequently in geometric figures
- May or may not be equal

### Angle Measurement

**Degrees**: The most common unit for measuring angles in basic trigonometry
- One complete rotation = 360°
- A right angle = 90°
- Degrees can be subdivided into minutes (') and seconds (")
- 1° = 60 minutes, 1 minute = 60 seconds

**Radians**: An alternative unit used especially in advanced mathematics
- One complete rotation = 2π radians
- A right angle = π/2 radians
- We'll use degrees primarily in this course, with brief introduction to radians

### Interior and Exterior Angles

**Interior Angles**: The angles inside a triangle (the ones we usually focus on)

**Exterior Angles**: Angles formed by extending one side of a triangle beyond a vertex
- An exterior angle and its adjacent interior angle are supplementary (sum to 180°)
- An exterior angle equals the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles

### Worked Examples

#### Example 1.4: Working with Complementary Angles

**Problem**: Two complementary angles have measures where one angle is 20° more than the other. Find both angles.

**Solution**:

Let x = the smaller angle
Then x + 20 = the larger angle

Since they're complementary, they sum to 90°:
$$x + (x + 20) = 90°$$

$$2x + 20 = 90°$$

$$2x = 70°$$

$$x = 35°$$

**Answer**:
- Smaller angle: **35°**
- Larger angle: **55°**

**Verification**: 35° + 55° = 90° ✓

#### Example 1.5: Identifying Supplementary Angles

**Problem**: Two supplementary angles have a ratio of 2:3. Find both angles.

**Solution**:

Let 2x = the smaller angle
Let 3x = the larger angle

Since they're supplementary, they sum to 180°:
$$2x + 3x = 180°$$

$$5x = 180°$$

$$x = 36°$$

**Answer**:
- Smaller angle: 2(36°) = **72°**
- Larger angle: 3(36°) = **108°**

**Verification**: 72° + 108° = 180° ✓

#### Example 1.6: Using Vertical Angles

**Problem**: Two lines intersect forming four angles. One angle measures 65°. What are the measures of the other three angles?

**Solution**:

When two lines intersect, they form two pairs of vertical angles:
- Vertical angles are equal
- Adjacent angles are supplementary (sum to 180°)

If one angle is 65°:
- Its vertical angle = **65°** (vertical angles equal)
- Each adjacent angle = 180° - 65° = **115°**
- The angle vertical to one of the 115° angles = **115°**

**Answer**: The four angles are **65°, 115°, 65°, and 115°**
