## Section 4.1: Special Triangle Geometry

### The 45-45-90 Triangle

A **45-45-90 triangle** is an isosceles right triangle with two 45° angles and one 90° angle.

**Key Properties**:
- Two legs are equal in length
- The two 45° angles are equal
- It's half of a square (cut diagonally)

**Side Ratio**:
If each leg has length **x**, then:
- Leg : Leg : Hypotenuse = **x : x : x√2**

Or simplified:
- **1 : 1 : √2**

**Why this ratio?**
Using the Pythagorean theorem:
$$x^2 + x^2 = h^2$$
$$2x^2 = h^2$$
$$h = x\sqrt{2}$$

**Visual Description**: Imagine a square with side length 1. Draw a diagonal. You've created two 45-45-90 triangles, each with legs of 1 and hypotenuse of √2 ≈ 1.414.

### The 30-60-90 Triangle

A **30-60-90 triangle** is a right triangle with angles of 30°, 60°, and 90°.

**Key Properties**:
- It's half of an equilateral triangle (cut vertically)
- The side opposite the 30° angle is the shortest
- The side opposite the 60° angle is the middle length
- The hypotenuse is the longest (opposite the 90° angle)

**Side Ratio**:
If the shortest leg (opposite 30°) has length **x**, then:
- Short leg : Long leg : Hypotenuse = **x : x√3 : 2x**

Or simplified:
- **1 : √3 : 2**

**Why this ratio?**
Start with an equilateral triangle (all sides length 2, all angles 60°). Drop a perpendicular from one vertex to the opposite side, creating two 30-60-90 triangles:
- Hypotenuse: 2 (original side)
- Short leg: 1 (half the base)
- Long leg: √3 (by Pythagorean theorem: √(2² - 1²) = √3)

### Memorizing the Ratios

**45-45-90**: Think "**1, 1, root 2**"
- Both legs equal
- Hypotenuse is leg × √2

**30-60-90**: Think "**1, root 3, 2**"
- Shortest leg: 1 (opposite 30°)
- Middle leg: √3 (opposite 60°)
- Hypotenuse: 2 (opposite 90°)

**Memory Tip**: The 30-60-90 ratio goes in increasing order: 1, √3 (≈1.73), 2

### Finding Actual Side Lengths

When you know one side of a special triangle, you can find all sides using the ratios.

**Strategy**:
1. Identify the type of special triangle
2. Determine which side you know (short leg, long leg, or hypotenuse)
3. Set up a proportion using the ratio
4. Solve for the unknowns

### Worked Examples

#### Example 4.1: Working with 45-45-90 Triangles

**Problem**: An isosceles right triangle has legs of 6 cm. Find the length of the hypotenuse.

**Solution**:

This is a 45-45-90 triangle with the ratio 1 : 1 : √2

If each leg = 6 cm, then using the ratio:
$$\frac{\text{leg}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

$$\frac{6}{h} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$$

$$h = 6\sqrt{2} \text{ cm}$$

Or more directly: hypotenuse = leg × √2 = 6√2 cm

**Answer**: The hypotenuse is **6√2 ≈ 8.49 cm**.

**Verification**: Using Pythagorean theorem:
$$6^2 + 6^2 = 36 + 36 = 72$$
$$(6\sqrt{2})^2 = 36(2) = 72$$ ✓

---

#### Example 4.2: Finding Legs from Hypotenuse (45-45-90)

**Problem**: A 45-45-90 triangle has a hypotenuse of 10 inches. Find the length of each leg.

**Solution**:

Using the ratio 1 : 1 : √2

If hypotenuse = 10, then:
$$\text{leg} \times \sqrt{2} = 10$$

$$\text{leg} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}}$$

Rationalizing the denominator:
$$\text{leg} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2} \text{ inches}$$

**Answer**: Each leg is **5√2 ≈ 7.07 inches**.

---

#### Example 4.3: Working with 30-60-90 Triangles

**Problem**: In a 30-60-90 triangle, the shorter leg (opposite 30°) is 5 meters. Find the other leg and the hypotenuse.

**Solution**:

Using the ratio 1 : √3 : 2

If short leg = 5 m, then we scale the entire ratio by 5:
- Short leg: 5 m (given)
- Long leg: 5√3 m
- Hypotenuse: 10 m

**Answer**:
- Long leg = **5√3 ≈ 8.66 meters**
- Hypotenuse = **10 meters**

**Verification**: Using Pythagorean theorem:
$$5^2 + (5\sqrt{3})^2 = 25 + 75 = 100 = 10^2$$ ✓

---

#### Example 4.4: Finding Other Sides from Hypotenuse (30-60-90)

**Problem**: A 30-60-90 triangle has a hypotenuse of 12 cm. Find both legs.

**Solution**:

Using the ratio 1 : √3 : 2

If hypotenuse = 12, then we scale the ratio:
$$2x = 12$$
$$x = 6$$

Therefore:
- Short leg: 6 cm
- Long leg: 6√3 cm
- Hypotenuse: 12 cm (given)

**Answer**:
- Short leg (opposite 30°) = **6 cm**
- Long leg (opposite 60°) = **6√3 ≈ 10.39 cm**

## Section 4.2: Reference Values

### Exact Trigonometric Values for Special Angles

For the angles 30°, 45°, and 60°, we can determine exact trigonometric values using our special triangles.

### Values from the 45-45-90 Triangle

Using a 45-45-90 triangle with legs of 1 and hypotenuse of √2:

**For 45°**:
$$\sin 45° = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

$$\cos 45° = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$$

$$\tan 45° = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{1}{1} = 1$$

**Note**: sin 45° = cos 45° because the triangle is isosceles!

### Values from the 30-60-90 Triangle

Using a 30-60-90 triangle with sides 1, √3, and 2:

**For 30°**:
$$\sin 30° = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$\cos 30° = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

$$\tan 30° = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}$$

**For 60°**:
$$\sin 60° = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$$

$$\cos 60° = \frac{1}{2}$$

$$\tan 60° = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{1} = \sqrt{3}$$

### Reference Table of Special Angle Values

| Angle | sin θ | cos θ | tan θ |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| 30° | 1/2 | √3/2 | √3/3 |
| 45° | √2/2 | √2/2 | 1 |
| 60° | √3/2 | 1/2 | √3 |

### Patterns to Notice

1. **Sine increases, cosine decreases** as the angle increases from 30° to 60°
2. **Complementary pairs**: sin 30° = cos 60° and sin 60° = cos 30°
3. **45° is symmetrical**: sin 45° = cos 45°
4. **Tangent pattern**: tan 30° < 1, tan 45° = 1, tan 60° > 1

### Alternative Forms

Some values can be written in different equivalent forms:

**√2/2** is equivalent to **1/√2** (rationalized form is preferred)

**√3/3** is equivalent to **1/√3** (rationalized form is preferred)

### Reciprocal Values

You can also find exact values for cosecant, secant, and cotangent:

**For 45°**:
- csc 45° = √2
- sec 45° = √2
- cot 45° = 1

**For 30°**:
- csc 30° = 2
- sec 30° = 2√3/3
- cot 30° = √3

**For 60°**:
- csc 60° = 2√3/3

### Worked Examples

#### Example 4.5: Evaluating Expressions with Special Angles

**Problem**: Evaluate without a calculator: sin 30° + cos 60°

**Solution**:

From the reference table:
- sin 30° = 1/2
- cos 60° = 1/2

$$\sin 30° + \cos 60° = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$$

**Answer**: **1**

**Note**: This makes sense because sin 30° = cos 60° (cofunction identity for complementary angles).

---

#### Example 4.6: Using Special Values in Equations

**Problem**: Solve for x: x · tan 60° = 12

**Solution**:

From the reference table: tan 60° = √3

$$x \cdot \sqrt{3} = 12$$

$$x = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3}}$$

Rationalizing:
$$x = \frac{12}{\sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{12\sqrt{3}}{3} = 4\sqrt{3}$$

**Answer**: x = **4√3 ≈ 6.93**

---

#### Example 4.7: Verifying Trigonometric Identities with Special Angles

**Problem**: Verify that sin² 30° + cos² 30° = 1

**Solution**:

From the reference table:
- sin 30° = 1/2
- cos 30° = √3/2

$$\sin^2 30° + \cos^2 30° = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2$$

$$= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$$ ✓

**Answer**: Identity verified!

**Note**: This is an example of the Pythagorean identity (which we'll study in Chapter 6).

#### Example 4.8: Application with Special Angles

**Problem**: A 30-foot ladder leans against a wall at a 60° angle with the ground. How high up the wall does it reach?

**Solution**:

This creates a 30-60-90 triangle:
- Hypotenuse (ladder) = 30 ft
- Angle with ground = 60°
- Height = opposite side

$$\sin 60° = \frac{h}{30}$$

$$\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{h}{30}$$

$$h = 30 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 15\sqrt{3} \text{ feet}$$

**Answer**: The ladder reaches **15√3 ≈ 25.98 feet** up the wall.
