### Topic Granularity Assessment

The course description provides sufficient granularity for concept enumeration:
- **Right triangles**: Properties, types, identification (5-8 concepts)
- **Pythagorean theorem**: Statement, proof, applications, verification (5-7 concepts)
- **Sine, cosine, tangent**: Definitions, ratios, relationships, reciprocals (15-20 concepts)
- **Using trigonometric functions**: Selecting ratios, solving equations, applications (20-25 concepts)
- **Finding missing lengths**: Various triangle scenarios, angle finding, real-world contexts (20-25 concepts)
- **Reference materials**: Shortcuts, mnemonics, formula collections (5-10 concepts)
