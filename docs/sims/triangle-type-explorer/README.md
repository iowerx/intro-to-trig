3. Watch the triangle type update in real-time
4. Create specific triangle types as instructed
5. Press 'R' to reset to the starting position

### For Educators
1. Use the activities in `index.md` for lesson planning
2. Project `main.html` during class for guided exploration
3. Assign student activities from the documentation
4. Use assessment strategies provided in `index.md`
5. Modify code in p5.js editor for customization

## Classroom Activities

The documentation includes 4 complete classroom activities:

1. **Triangle Type Creation Challenge** (10 min)
   - Students race to create specific triangle types
   - Great for formative assessment

2. **Prediction and Verification** (15 min)
   - Students predict triangle properties
   - Use simulator to verify
   - Builds conceptual understanding

3. **Constraint Investigation** (12 min)
   - Answer constraint-based questions
   - Explore impossible combinations
   - Deep conceptual engagement

4. **Real-World Triangle Hunting** (20 min)
   - Connect to architecture and nature
   - Classify real-world triangles
   - Interdisciplinary connections

**Framework**: p5.js v1.11.10  
**Size**: 32 KB total (uncompressed)  
**Browser Support**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (all modern versions)  
**No Server Required**: Runs entirely in the browser  
**No External Dependencies**: Only p5.js library from CDN  

## Embedding in Other Sites

### Simple iframe Embed
```html
<iframe src="https://iowerx.github.io/intro-to-trig/sims/triangle-type-explorer/main.html" 
        height="512" 
        scrolling="no"></iframe>
```

### Canvas Height Calculation

## Customization

The p5.js code is fully editable and can be customized for:

- **Different colors**: Change 'aliceblue', 'white', 'silver', 'red' color values
- **Different initial triangle**: Modify v1, v2, v3 initial positions
- **Additional measurements**: Add perimeter, area, or other calculations
- **Special triangles**: Highlight when 30-60-90 or 45-45-90 triangles are created
- **Tolerance values**: Adjust 5px side tolerance or 5° angle tolerance
- **Canvas size**: Change drawHeight, controlHeight, or canvasWidth constants

### Editing in p5.js Editor

1. Go to https://editor.p5js.org/
2. Create a new sketch
3. Copy entire contents of `triangle-type-explorer.js`
4. Paste into the editor
5. Modify as desired
6. Save to your p5.js account
