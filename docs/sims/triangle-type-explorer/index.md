## Overview

The Triangle Type Explorer is an interactive educational simulation that helps middle and high school students understand triangle classification through hands-on exploration. By dragging the three vertices of a triangle, students can visually observe how side lengths and angles determine the triangle's classification.

The MicroSim provides real-time feedback, displaying:
- **Side-based classification**: Equilateral, Isosceles, or Scalene
- **Angle-based classification**: Acute, Right, or Obtuse
- **Combined classification**: For example, "Isosceles Right" or "Scalene Obtuse"
- **Precise measurements**: All side lengths and angles displayed in real-time

## How to Use

### Basic Interaction

1. **Start with the initial triangle** displayed on the canvas
2. **Click and drag** any of the three red vertices (labeled A, B, C) to reshape the triangle
3. **Watch the classification update** automatically as you adjust the triangle
4. **Observe the measurements** showing all side lengths and angles

### Navigation

- **Drag vertices** to any position within the drawing area
- **Press 'R'** or **click Reset** to return to the initial triangle configuration
- **Vertices snap to bounds** to prevent them from moving outside the canvas

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- **R key** - Reset triangle to initial position

## Learning Objectives

After using this MicroSim, students will be able to:

### Remember
- Recall the definitions of triangle types based on sides (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene)
- Recall the definitions of triangle types based on angles (Acute, Right, Obtuse)

### Understand
- Explain the properties that define each type of triangle
- Understand why certain combinations are possible or impossible
- Understand that angles in any triangle sum to 180°

### Apply
- Classify given triangles based on measurements
- Create specific triangle types using the simulation
- Use the measurements to verify triangle properties

### Analyze
- Determine how changing one vertex affects the triangle's classification
- Analyze the relationship between side lengths and angles
- Investigate which triangle types are most commonly found in nature and architecture

## Classroom Activities

### Activity 1: Triangle Type Creation Challenge

**Time**: 10 minutes | **Difficulty**: Medium

Students race to create specific triangle types:

1. Start the timer
2. Ask students to create one of each type:
   - An **Equilateral** triangle
   - An **Isosceles Right** triangle
   - A **Scalene Acute** triangle
   - An **Obtuse Isosceles** triangle
   - A **Right Scalene** triangle

3. Verify success by checking the displayed classification
4. Discuss which was easiest/hardest to create

**Discussion Questions:**
- Why is an Equilateral Right impossible?
- Can a scalene triangle be acute? Right? Obtuse?
- What's the relationship between being isosceles and the angles?

### Activity 2: Prediction and Verification

**Time**: 15 minutes | **Difficulty**: High

1. **Predict**: Without using the simulator, students draw a triangle they think is isosceles acute
2. **Verify**: Use the simulator to check their prediction
3. **Analyze**: If wrong, what did they misunderstand?
4. **Repeat** with different triangle types

This activity highlights the difference between what we see and what the measurements show.

### Activity 3: Constraint Investigation

**Time**: 12 minutes | **Difficulty**: Medium-High

Pose constraint questions:

- "Create a right triangle that is NOT isosceles. Is this possible?"
- "Create an isosceles triangle that is NOT acute. What types work?"
- "Create the 'most obtuse' triangle you can. What's the maximum obtuse angle?"
- "What happens if you try to make all three angles equal?"

Students explore and record findings, then discuss as a class.

### Activity 4: Real-World Triangle Hunting

**Time**: 20 minutes | **Difficulty**: Medium

1. Show students images of structures, buildings, and natural objects with triangles
2. Ask them to predict what type each triangle is
3. Use the simulator to create similar triangles
4. Classify the triangles and discuss why that type appears in that context

**Examples:**
- Bridge trusses (often isosceles or right triangles)
- Roof structures (often isosceles)
- Mountain/pyramid shapes (often acute or right triangles)
- Road signs (equilateral triangles)

## Mathematical Concepts

### Triangle Classification by Sides

| Type | Definition | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Equilateral** | All three sides equal length | All angles are 60°, always acute |
| **Isosceles** | Exactly two sides equal length | Two angles are equal (base angles), can be acute, right, or obtuse |
| **Scalene** | All three sides different lengths | All angles are different, can be acute, right, or obtuse |

### Triangle Classification by Angles

| Type | Definition | Characteristics | All Angles |
|------|-----------|-----------------|------------|
| **Acute** | All angles less than 90° | Often appears in nature | < 90°, < 90°, < 90° |
| **Right** | One angle exactly 90° | Related to Pythagorean theorem | 90°, < 90°, < 90° |
| **Obtuse** | One angle greater than 90° | Less common in regular structures | > 90°, < 90°, < 90° |

### Mathematical Relationships

**Angle Sum Property:**
In any triangle, the three angles always sum to exactly 180°.

**Distance Formula** (used to calculate side lengths):
$$d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$$

**Law of Cosines** (used to calculate angles):
$$\cos(A) = \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2}{2bc}$$

## Technical Details

### How the Simulator Calculates Classifications

**Side Classification Algorithm:**
1. Measure the distance between each pair of vertices
2. Sort the three distances
3. If the largest and smallest are nearly equal → Equilateral
4. Else if any two are nearly equal → Isosceles
5. Else → Scalene

**Angle Classification Algorithm:**
1. Calculate angles using the Law of Cosines
2. Check if any angle ≈ 90° → Right
3. Else if all angles < 90° → Acute
4. Else if any angle > 90° → Obtuse

**Tolerance Values:**
- Sides considered "equal" if within 5 pixels
- Angles considered "right" if within 5 degrees of 90°

### Implementation Standards

This MicroSim follows the educational MicroSim standards:
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and container widths
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Measurements update instantly as vertices move
- **Accessible**: High-contrast colors, large fonts (16pt minimum), screen reader support
- **Educator-Friendly**: Code is well-commented and can be modified in p5.js editor

## Common Misconceptions Addressed

This MicroSim helps address common student misconceptions:

1. **"All right triangles are isosceles"**
   → Students can create scalene right triangles, seeing they're perfectly valid

2. **"Obtuse triangles can't be isosceles"**
   → Students can create obtuse isosceles triangles, showing the concept is possible

3. **"If a triangle has one equal side, it's isosceles"**
   → By requiring exactly two equal sides, students see the distinction clearly

4. **"Triangle types are independent"**
   → By showing both classifications together, students see how they interact

5. **"You can make a triangle with any three measurements"**
   → As students drag, they observe the Triangle Inequality Theorem in action

## Troubleshooting and Support

### Common Issues

**Q: The classification doesn't match what I expect**
A: Check the measurements displayed. The simulator uses precise geometric calculations. You might be creating a different type than intended!

**Q: One vertex won't move**
A: Make sure you're clicking on the red circle (the vertex), not just near it. The clickable area is 20 pixels from the center.

**Q: The triangle looks right but the classification is wrong**
A: The tolerance for "equal" sides is 5 pixels. Very small differences in length create different classifications.

**Q: I want to modify the simulation**
A: All code can be edited in the p5.js editor (editor.p5js.org). Paste the entire contents of triangle-type-explorer.js into the editor, make changes, and save a new version!

## For Educators

### Assessment Ideas

**Formative Assessment**
- Can students create specific triangle types on command?
- Do they understand why certain combinations are impossible?
- Can they explain the classification rules?

**Summative Assessment**
